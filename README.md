Just some flying sodas for help for rendering object and material files


There are different ways to render 3D asset files into Aframe. Here is an example of one of them. It consists of using the <a-entity> tag itself to declare the object and material source files.


Also, do not forget to include other texture jpegs and pngs along which came along with the 3D assets, otherwise the 3D model's texture would render just as black. This is because the object and material files are searching for those files while they are rendered. 

Furthermore, do not rename the file, other than the name that was given when it was exported, because it looks for a specific path.

##Happy WebVR!!
